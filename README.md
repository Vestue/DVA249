# TUI System Manager
## Description
A TUI designed to help new users of Linux to work with groups, users and directories.
It does this by giving an easy way to create new ones, remove existing ones, and toggle any permissions upon request.

Alough it was designed with new users as the focus, the TUI was also developed with a mindset that an experienced user should be able to use it very fast, and thus would be faster than using the CLI as one normally would.

## Usage
Navigation works by pressing a single button, for example `g` which causes the user to move into the group menu.
The navigating buttons are represented by colorful characters in the terminal.

The buttons are mapped to represent certain words and thus changes depending on current context, but they are not too different as we have tried to standardize as much as possible.
### Examples
* *u*: users
* *d*: directories
* *g*: groups
* *n*: network

We have also provided a way for the user to exit instantly wherever in the program the user is.
This is done by using: `q`
