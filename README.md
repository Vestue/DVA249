### TODO
1. Fix SUID and GUID counts in all-toggle. The current count function requires $1 to be "g" or "u" which it never will while in "a" mode.
2. Going back from the permissions toggle-menu causes the program to ask the user to enter another directory. It should just go back to the main directory function.
